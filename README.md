# Image Recognition With Google Inception 5h

Classifying images with the help of a  pre-trained CNN model dubbed Inception5h from Google. This model is trained and tested on the ImageNet dataset and is capable of classifying images across 1000 categories. This variant of the Inception model is preferred for  DeepDream and other imaging techniques. This is because it allows the input image to be any size, and the optimized images are also prettier.
